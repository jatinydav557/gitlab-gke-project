## ✨ Key MLOps Features & Practices

This project incorporates a wide array of MLOps principles and tools:

* **⚙️ Modular & Object-Oriented Design (`src` directory):**
    * **`components` Module:** Contains distinct classes for each step of the ML pipeline (`data_processing`, `model_training`).
    * **Data Processing Component:** Includes functionalities for loading raw data, handling outliers (e.g., on 'SepalWidthCm' using IQR method), and splitting data into training and testing sets. It serializes processed data (X_train, y_train, etc.) using `joblib`.
    * **Model Training Component:** Manages loading processed data, training the Decision Tree Classifier (with `criterion="gini"`, `max_depth=30`), saving the trained model to `artifacts/models/model.pkl`, and evaluating its performance.
    * **Model Evaluation:** Calculates and logs key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Generates and saves a confusion matrix visualization (`confusion_matrix.png`) for visual evaluation of model performance.
    * **`logger` & `custom_exception`:** Implements robust logging for tracking execution flow and custom exception handling for graceful error management and clear debugging.
* **🧪 Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes a `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `scikit-learn` for its effectiveness in multi-class classification and interpretability.
* **🚀 Automated CI/CD with GitLab CI/CD:**
    * **`.gitlab-ci.yml`:** Defines a multi-stage pipeline (`checkout`, `build`, `deploy`) that automates the entire CI/CD workflow.
    * **Docker-in-Docker (dind):** The `build_docker_image` stage uses `docker:dind` service to enable Docker operations directly within the CI/CD job, allowing for building and pushing images.
* **🐳 Docker Containerization:** The Flask web application, serving the inference API, is containerized using Docker (`Dockerfile`), ensuring consistent execution across different environments (development, CI/CD, production on GKE).
* **📦 Google Artifact Registry:** Docker images are built and pushed to Google Artifact Registry (e.g., `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/circle-ci-project-462514/my-repo-gitlab/mlops-app:latest`) for secure, versioned storage and seamless integration with GCP deployment services.
* **🌐 Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Deployment:** The containerized application is deployed to GKE for scalable, highly available, and resilient model serving.
    * **Kubernetes Deployment (`Deployment` resource):** Ensures multiple replicas (e.g., `replicas: 2`) of the application pod are running for high availability and load distribution.
    * **Kubernetes Service (`Service` resource of type `LoadBalancer`):** Exposes the application to external traffic on `port: 80`, managing load balancing across the deployed pods that listen on `targetPort: 5000`.
* **🔒 Secure Credential Management:** Implemented secure handling of GCP service account keys (`$GCP_SA_KEY`) within GitLab CI/CD secrets, which are decoded and used to authenticate with GCP services (`gcloud auth activate-service-account`). This ensures sensitive information is not exposed in the codebase.
* **☁️ Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Integration:** Leverages key GCP services like GKE and Artifact Registry as the cloud-native infrastructure for the MLOps pipeline.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project's architecture is designed for automation, scalability, and reliability:

**Data Flow & Components:**
1.  **Data Source:** Raw Iris dataset (`data.csv`).
2.  **Code Repository:** The entire codebase is hosted on GitLab.
3.  **CI/CD Trigger:** Any push to the main branch (or other configured branches) on GitLab triggers the `.gitlab-ci.yml` pipeline.
4.  **GitLab CI/CD Pipeline:**
    * **Checkout Stage:** Checks out the latest code from the repository.
    * **Build Stage:** Authenticates with GCP using a service account key, then builds the Docker image for the Flask inference application and pushes it to Google Artifact Registry.
    * **Deploy Stage:** Authenticates with GCP again, configures `kubectl` to interact with the target GKE cluster, and applies the `kubernetes-deployment.yaml` manifest to deploy the application.
5.  **Inference Service:** The deployed Flask application on GKE (managed by a Kubernetes Deployment and exposed by a LoadBalancer Service) serves real-time Iris species predictions via a simple web UI.
6.  **Security:** GCP Service Accounts and securely managed variables within GitLab CI/CD handle access and permissions throughout the pipeline and deployment.

*(Consider adding a visual architecture diagram here for better understanding, e.g., a simple block diagram showing the flow from GitLab -> GitLab CI/CD -> GCP Artifact Registry -> GKE)*

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

Developing this end-to-end MLOps pipeline presented several interesting challenges, which were successfully overcome:

* **Data Quality & Outlier Handling:** Ensuring the quality of the Iris dataset, especially handling potential outliers in numerical features.
    * **Solution:** Implemented a `handle_outliers` method in `DataProcessing` to effectively manage outliers using the IQR method for specific columns like `SepalWidthCm`.
* **Model Selection & Comprehensive Evaluation:** Choosing an appropriate classification model and ensuring its performance is rigorously evaluated.
    * **Solution:** Employed a `DecisionTreeClassifier` and thoroughly evaluated it using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score). A confusion matrix is generated and saved as a `PNG` file for visual analysis of classification performance.
* **Kubernetes Deployment & Service Exposure:** Configuring Kubernetes deployments for high availability with multiple replicas and exposing the Flask application externally through a LoadBalancer.
    * **Solution:** Defined `Deployment` and `Service` resources in `kubernetes-deployment.yaml`. The `Deployment` ensures `replicas: 2` for resilience, and the `Service` of `type: LoadBalancer` makes the application accessible via an external IP.
* **GitLab CI/CD & GCP Integration:** Setting up GitLab CI/CD to securely authenticate with GCP, build and push Docker images to Artifact Registry, and then deploy to GKE.
    * **Solution:** Configured `.gitlab-ci.yml` to use the `google/cloud-sdk` image, securely manage the `GCP_SA_KEY` environment variable, perform `gcloud auth` commands, and then use `docker build`/`push` and `kubectl apply` commands for the deployment process.
* **Docker-in-Docker (dind) in CI/CD:** Enabling Docker operations (build/push) directly within the GitLab CI/CD jobs.
    * **Solution:** Utilized the `docker:dind` service within the `build_docker_image` job in `.gitlab-ci.yml` and configured `DOCKER_HOST` and `DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR` variables to allow direct interaction with the Docker daemon.
* **Environment Consistency:** Ensuring the application and its dependencies are consistent across local development, Docker containers, and the GKE production environment.
    * **Solution:** Docker containerization packages the application and its `pip install -e .` dependencies into a single, portable unit, guaranteeing consistent execution.
* **Small Typos - But with exception handling and a bit of chatgpt i overcame the errors and debugged the application.**

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* **MLflow Integration:** Integrate MLflow for more comprehensive experiment tracking, logging of metrics and parameters, model versioning, and a centralized model registry.
* **Automated Retraining:** Implement automated retraining triggers based on new data availability, data drift, or model performance degradation in production.
* **More Sophisticated Models:** Experiment with other classification algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, or even simple Neural Networks) and perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search.
* **Monitoring & Alerting:** Integrate with GCP's Operations Suite (Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging, Cloud Trace) for advanced application monitoring, performance tracking, and setting up alerts for anomalies.
* **Cost Optimization:** Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) in GKE to automatically scale the number of pods based on CPU utilization or custom metrics, optimizing resource usage and cost.
* **User Authentication/Authorization:** Add authentication and authorization layers to the Flask API for secure access to the prediction service.
* **Data Versioning:** Implement Data Version Control (DVC) to track changes in the dataset, enhancing reproducibility.
